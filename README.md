# 🧠 C Learning Lab 🚀

Welcome to my **C Programming Playground** — a personal repo where I practice, break, and build using pure C.

## 📌 About This Repo

This repository contains my journey through the C language, including:
- ✅ Basic syntax and concepts
- 🔁 Loops and conditionals
- 📦 Functions and arrays
- 🔗 Pointers and memory
- 📂 Mini-projects and practice problems


## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Language: `C (C99/C11)`
- Compiler: `gcc`
- OS: `Arch Linux`

## 🚧 Currently Practicing

- Pointers
- String manipulation
- File handling

## 📚 Why I'm Doing This

C builds the foundation of how computers really work.  
I want to master the fundamentals — to think like a real programmer, not just use frameworks.
