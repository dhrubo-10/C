# OS_0.01

An experimental os for exploring low-level operating system concepts.  
This repository contains my custom kernel files, boot code, and utilities written in C and Assembly.  
The goal is to understand, learn and create..a structured os kernel and to practice systems programming at a low level.

This is a personal project. And I'm still working since 2021. Some files are incomplete and and will be update over time with bug fixe and changes.

## Directories
Just check the folders and files. You'll get it. 


## PS

I'm still baaaad at Rust… so if I ever get good at it (maybe not), I guess I’ll rewrite the whole thing in Rust.
