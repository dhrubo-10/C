# C Learning Lab 

Welcome to my **C Programming Playground** — a personal repo where I practice, break, and build using pure C.

## About This Repo

This repository contains my journey through the C language, including:
- Syntax and concepts
- Mini-projects and practice problems
- My custom Linux kernel project and updates on that as i keep working.

## Tools Used

- Language: `C (C99/C11), ANSI C`
- Compiler: `gcc, clang, llvm`
- OS: `Arch`
- Editor: `vim / subl`

## Why I'm Doing This

Working on low-level programming is not just a hobby for me — it's my favorite pastime and a true passion. I enjoy building kernels while also practicing fundamental C projects, purely for the fun of it.
